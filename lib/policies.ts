Overview
CivicVigilance helps people report local civic problems (for example potholes, garbage piles, broken streetlights, leaks) and share them with the community and relevant authorities. We designed the product so that you stay in control: you choose what to share, when to share, and who sees it.

Information We Collect
- Account: email address and a password you set. Name is optional.
- Content you submit: photos, descriptions, categories/tags, comments, votes.
- Location (optional): precise GPS coordinates and a human‑readable address if you enable location for a report. You can edit the pin before sharing.
- Device permissions: camera, photo library, location, notifications (all optional and requested at time of use).
- Diagnostics: minimal, aggregated logs needed to keep the service reliable and secure.

How We Use Data
- Create and display your reports on the public feed and on your profile ("My Reports").
- Show nearby issues and trends and enable upvotes/downvotes and comments.
- Generate a shareable post that may include your description, address and map link when you choose to share externally.
- Suggest relevant civic authority handles for tagging (based on issue type/area, where available).
- Protect users and the platform (spam/misuse detection, abuse handling, legal compliance).

What We Share
- Public content: reports, images, comments, vote counts, timestamps and (if you include it) location/address are public in the app. Sharing to other platforms only happens when you explicitly choose to share.
- Service providers: we use third‑party services to operate the app (e.g., Supabase for authentication/storage, platform push services). Providers process data on our behalf under contracts and do not sell your data.
- Legal: we may disclose information if required by law or to protect users and the service.

Your Choices and Controls
- Location control: you can disable precise location, or move the map pin to a less precise place before posting.
- Edit/Delete: you can edit or delete your own reports and comments. Deletions may persist in backups for a limited time.
- Account: you can export or delete your account. Deleting your account removes your profile and attempts to disassociate remaining content where feasible.
- Notifications: you can manage in‑app preferences and OS‑level permissions at any time.

Data Retention
- Account data is kept while your account is active. Public reports remain visible unless you remove them or they are moderated/flagged. We may keep limited records needed for security, fraud prevention, or legal obligations.

Children
- The service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). Do not use the app if you are below the applicable age.

Security
- We use encryption in transit, role‑based access, and industry‑standard controls. No online system can be 100% secure; please report issues you discover.

International Transfers
- Data may be processed in other countries where our providers operate. Protections and contracts are in place; laws may differ from your home country.

Third‑Party Links and Sharing
- If you share to external platforms (for example X/Twitter, WhatsApp), their privacy policies apply. We do not post on your behalf without your action.

Purpose and Mission
CivicVigilance empowers people to report civic problems and build constructive visibility so authorities and communities can act. We are not an emergency service or a government body.

Using the App
- You must create an account and provide accurate information. Keep your credentials secure; you are responsible for activity on your account.
- The app is provided for lawful, community‑minded reporting. Do not trespass, interfere with public safety, or place yourself or others at risk when capturing photos or locations.
- Do not rely on the app for emergency response. If there is immediate danger, contact local emergency services.

Your Content
- You retain ownership of the content you submit. By posting, you grant CivicVigilance a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, display, distribute, and create non‑substantive adaptations of your content for the purpose of operating and improving the service.
- You represent that you have the necessary rights to the content you post and that it does not violate others’ rights or applicable laws.
- Public nature: reports, images, comments, and approximate locations you include are public within the app and may be viewed, shared, and indexed by others.

Community Expectations (Reddit‑style)
- Be constructive and respectful. Debate ideas, not people.
- No harassment, hate speech, illegal content, or personal data of private individuals without consent.
- No spam, scams, or knowingly false/misleading reports. Avoid duplicate reports when possible; upvote existing ones.
- Mark sensitive images and avoid graphic or identifying content where inappropriate.

Voting and Threads
- Upvotes/downvotes are for prioritization and quality signals, not harassment.
- Comment threads are public; replies are nested. We may remove content that violates these terms or local law.

Moderation and Enforcement
- We may hide, remove, or restrict content or accounts that violate these terms or pose risk.
- We may preserve content for moderation, security, or legal purposes even after deletion requests when required by law.

Third‑Party Services and Links
- The app integrates with external services (e.g., mapping providers, OS share sheets, Supabase for auth/storage). Their terms and policies apply when you use them.

No Warranty; Limitation of Liability
- The service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that reports will be seen or acted upon by authorities.
- To the maximum extent allowed by law, CivicVigilance is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, goodwill, or profits.

Termination
- You may stop using the service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for any reason, including violations of these terms or legal requests.

Governing Law
- These terms are governed by the laws of your place of residence unless your local law requires otherwise. If you operate the service on behalf of an organization, specify the governing law and venue applicable to that organization.

Changes to These Terms
- We may update these Terms to reflect new features or legal requirements. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
